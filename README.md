# MyFirstCSharpProgram

 This is my first actual C# program that I wrote on my own. 
 I wrote the actual conversational strings in Swedish since I aimed 
 this program to possibly be the first real interaction my kids would
 have with computers, iPads aside...
  
 Simply put it asks for your name and then greets you. 
 If you don't return the greeting, you hurt the computer's feelings. 
 You'd better apologize!
 
 This is of course a work in progress...
